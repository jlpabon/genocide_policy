# Genocide Policy Research To-Do List
1. [Fragile State Index](https://fragilestatesindex.org/) <br>
    (a) Get historical data of indicators back to 1945-ish <br>
    [ ] Identify indicators for which it will be easy to get data <br>
    [ ] Get that data <br>
    [ ] Figure out what we can do to analyze that data <br>
    [ ] Analyze and assess. <br>
    [ ] Repeat with harder data <br>
    (b) further analysis and test cases
2. Time Series Analysis: <br>
    (a) What time series methodologies are appropriate to project indicators (like GDP) forward in time? Basic time series analysis that Victor is familiar with requires certain assumptions (either staionary time series or autoregressive) - is that sufficent? <br>
    (b) What about mulifactor/multivariable time series analysis?
3.  Clustering - select appropriate clustering algorithm for nearest neighbor selection <br>
4. Data storytelling - prepare case examples
5. Lit Review
6. Game it out - create wargame type experiments and try this out in repeated trials to see if effective.
